# DESCRIPTION

This is a [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist%3A%3AZilla) plugin to filter the main module POD to generate a `README` file.  It allows developers to
determine which sections are incorporated into the `README` rather than dumping the entire main module documentation.

This also supports including special sections for showing the most recent entry in the `Changes` file, showing the
runtime requirements, and including installation instructions.

This was written as a successor to [Pod::Readme](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod%3A%3AReadme) that works better with [Pod::Weaver](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod%3A%3AWeaver).

# RECENT CHANGES

- Enhancements
    - Add support for append/prepend to generated fallback sections, GH#3.

See the `Changes` file for more details.
